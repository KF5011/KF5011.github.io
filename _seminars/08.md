# Basic Idea
We want to control some system.

![plant](control.svg)

In general a "_system_" has an _input_, which may be just an on/off switch, and has a measureable _response_, say temperature.

To control a system we measure the value we want to change (temperature)
and make decisions on how to set the inputs

* if too cold turn the heating on
* if too hot tuen the heating off

# Domestic heating system
For a simple House heating system, we can measure the temperature and
decide how to turn the heating on or off.

* [s8.1](https://github.com/kf5011/s8.1/) A control program to run on the K64F
* [s8.1.j](https://github.com/kf5011/s8.1.j/) A Java program that models a house

Download and run both
> start the java program from the shell
>```shell
>  java -jar House.jar
>````
{: .example}

Observe the behaviour:
* How even is the temperature of house?
* Modify the control program to read a potentiometer and use that as a temperature setting
* Modify the messages sent to include the "_setpoint_" the desired temperature and add that to the plot.  
</section>

The simple _on_/_off_ control is called "_bang-bang_" control.  
In some  systems this can cause problems.

# water heating
The office kitchen has a wall mounted water-heater ([s8.2.j](https://github.com/kf5011/s8.2.j)).  The same control scheme as for the house is used ([s8.2](https://github.com/kf5011/s8.2)).

* It is observed that the heater switched on and off rapidly.
* Why is this?
* Is this a problem for the heater?

# Feedback control
![plant](feedback.svg)

A classic control system measures the _error_ between the measured value and the desired value.  It then uses this to calculate how to change the inputs to the system.

The pre-requisite is that the strength of the input can be smoothly varied over the range of possible values and small adjustments made.

# Human control
When you drive a car, you don't calculate (in your head) how far to push down the peddle to go at say 30mph.  Instead if you need to go faster, you push down a little further, and if you need to go slower, lift your foot a little.  If you need to go a lot faster or slower, you move your foot more, and ease off as you reach the speed you need.

# Proportional control
A scheme very similar to the way a human drives is called "_Proportional control_".  The _error_ value is multiplied by some value, and the input changed by that amount.  The _error_ is calculated so that a negative value reduces the input, and a positive one increases the input.
