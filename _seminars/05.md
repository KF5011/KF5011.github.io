# Solutions
## Seminar 1
  1. Wrapper for LEDs
     + Use an arrray of `DigitalOut` [my solution](https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/solution1.1)
     + A simple class for an LEDs use `git checkout led-class` on the above repository (once you have a clone or fork)
  2. Wrapper for buttons `ispressed`
     + C like function and array [my solution](https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/solution1.2)
     + A simple class like wrapper, use `git checkout button-class`

### Exercises
 1. Flash at a given rate.  The trick here is to calculate the time for the `wait` function to give the desired flashing frequency.
 The Period is _1/frequency_ and the wait times are half that
    + for 1Hz
    ```c
    red.on();
    wait(0.5);
    red.off();
    wait(0.5);
    ```
    + for 10Hz
    ```c
    red.on();
    wait(0.05);
    red.off();
    wait(0.05);
    ```
    + for 45 flashes per minute.  Thats 45/60 flashes per second, the period is 60/45=4/3, the wait times are 2/3seconds
    ```c
    red.on();
    wait(0.6667);
    red.off();
    wait(0.6667);
    ```
