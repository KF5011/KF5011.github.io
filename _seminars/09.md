# Controlling Devices
There are several sensors that provide information about the
devices environment.

1. Accelerometer
2. Magnetometer
3. Temperature (see repository s5.1)

In addition we have the existing digital and analogue inputs that other sensors can use.

The devices we can control parse_block_html
1. LEDs
2. Speaker
3. LCD
4. Serial (and other communications)
Along with other digital, PWM, and Analogue (DAC), that could be used to control devices.

# Control Systems
Common applications for these kind of embedded systems is to  
provide control logic for some system.

As we don't have physical systems to hand, we can still simulate their effects for you.

## A System
Any system (such as a house) has inputs, _how much heat the boiler provides_; and an output, _the temperature of the house_

Control systems provide a way of regulating the system to exhibit a particular property, _the temerature you **want** the house to be at_
