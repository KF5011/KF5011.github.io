### LED output
Clone the repository [s1.1](https://github.com/kf5011/s1.1)
this contains a basic blinky program.

Build the program and upload it into the FRDM-K64F.  Once done you will need to press the reset button.

**resources**
  1. Refer to the LED diagram in the [FRDM K64F Userguide]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/FRDMK64FUG.pdf %}#page=14) section 10, page 14 for pin connections.
  2. Summary of important [pin names](https://os.mbed.com/teams/Freescale/wiki/frdm-k64f-pinnames)
  3. An [overview](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/FRDM-K64F/) of the board and the mbed library
{: .note}

The start point is ([s1.1](https://github.com/kf5011/s1.1)):
```c
#include <mbed.h>

int main() {

    DigitalOut red(PTB22);

    while(1) {
      red.write(0);
      wait(0.5);
      red.write(1);
      wait(0.5);
    }
}
```
{: .code }

 1. Using the [FRDM K64F Userguide]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/FRDMK64FUG.pdf%}#page=14) and/or the [FRDM K64F Schematic]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/FRDM-K64F_SCH.pdf%}), identify the pins that drive the Green and Blue LEDs on the board.
  <span class="answer">Green LED pin PTE26 (aka [LED_GREEN](https://os.mbed.com/teams/Freescale/wiki/frdm-k64f-pinnames)), Blue LED pin PTB21 (aka [LED_BLUE](https://os.mbed.com/teams/Freescale/wiki/frdm-k64f-pinnames))</span>
 1. Modify the program to manage the Green and Blue LEDs in addition to the Red LED.  <span class="answer">[solution 1.1](https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/solution1.1)</span>
 1. Modify the flashing pattern to make use of all three LEDs.

{: .question}


<section class="question">
1. What value needs to be written to the pin in order to
 * turn the LED on? <span class="answer">&nbsp;0&nbsp;</span>
 * turn the LED off? <span class="answer">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</span>
2. From the Schematic can you identify why the values are what they are?  
<span class="hint">What is pin-2 of the LED package connected to?</span>    
<p class="answer">   
Pin-2 of the LED package is connected to 3.3V (logic high/1).   
If a 1 is output from the pin it is at 3.3V, there is no voltage difference across the LED so it does not light.   
Output a 0 there is a voltage difference and so the LED turns on. </p>
</section>

<section class="question">
1.  Write a wrapper that provides functions for `on()`, `off()`, and/or `set()` that takes into account the way the LEDs are wired.

### Push Button input
Clone the repository [s1.2](https://github.com/kf5011/s1.2).

This is the base level LED driver from [s1.1](https://github.com/kf5011/s1.1) with the addition of a single push button (One of the two on the base board.)

```c
#include <mbed.h>

#include <stdbool.h>

int main() {
    bool flashing = false;

    DigitalOut red(PTB22);
    DigitalIn  btn(PTC6);

    while(1) {
        if( btn.read() ) flashing = true;
            else         flashing = false;

        if(flashing){
            red.write(0);
            wait(0.5);
            red.write(1);
            wait(0.5);
        }else{
            red.write(1);
        }
    }
}
```
{: .code}

1. Locate the buttons (switches SW2 and SW3) on the [FRDM K64F Schematic]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/FRDM-K64F_SCH.pdf%}#page=4).
2. Using the schematic and observing the behaviour of the program what can be deduced about:
    * What value is read when the button is
        + pressed? <span class="answer">&nbsp;0&nbsp;</span>
        + _not_ pressed? <span class="answer">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</span>
    * Why is this the case?   
    <p class="answer">The Pins are connected to 3.3V via a pull-up resistor, so the pin reads a logic 1 when the button in not pressed.  Pressing the button creates a direct connection to ground (0V) so the pin reads a logic 0</p>
1. Add a wrapper function that evaluates as
  `bool ispressed( /*button*/ )`{: .code}
  that returns the correct state of the button.

### Application Shield IO
The Application Shield has a second RGB-LED and a 5-way joystick like switch.

1. Refering to the Application Shield [Schematic]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/ApplicationShield V_1_0_0 SCH.pdf%}),
  * Identify the pins that drive the shield RGB-LED
        + Red is on [D5](https://os.mbed.com/teams/Freescale/wiki/frdm-k64f-pinnames) which is  [PTA2](https://os.mbed.com/teams/Freescale/wiki/frdm-k64f-pinnames)

2. Extend the capabilities of the LED wrapper functions to include the Shield's LEDs. <span class="answer">[solution 1.3](https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/solution-1.3/)</span>
{: .question}

1. Find the 5-way switch on the schematic
  * Is it wired the same way with respect to the _ground_ and _3.3V_ signals?   
  <span class="answer">No.  The switches are wired the opposite way round.</span>
  * What will the impact be on the implementation of the `ispressed()` function?  
  <span class="answer">Not nice, I need to invert some pin readings and not others.  Solution look at the truth table for (_a_ xor _true_)</span>

* Traffic light sequence:  Using Blue instead of Amber:
  * create a sequence of led on and offs that replicate a traffic light sequence.  What timings do you use for each phase?
  * using the RGB LED on the base and the shield create a junction with two traffic lights:
    + what are the allowed combinations of lights?

* Maritime navigation lights have characteristic sequences of flashes,
  (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_characteristic)),
  How would you create the following patterns
  + a flashing light has rate of 37.5 flashes per minute, the light is off for three times longer than it is on
  + A light flashes (as above) showing 3 flashes, every 6 seconds.

* safety switch (two hand start) is a common feature of machinery.  To start flashing both switches (buttons) must be pressed together.
{: .question}

* flash at variable rates:  a countdown timer on a camera flashes initially at 1 flash per second, it flashes faster over 10 seconds, showing a continuous light just before the camera and flash fires.
