In this seminar we'll look at simple networked communications using UDP sockets.

<!--more-->

You'll need :

* An MBED board connected to the off-campus networked
  + get hold of a spare ethernet cable (filing cabinet in network lab)
  + plug the MBED FRDM-K64F into one of the four network ports on the bench.
  + in the network cabinet connect the port to a free connection on the "Internet" switch.  (just as you would for the PCs)
* You will need a PC also connected to the off-campus network (the lab machines will do fine)
* The exercises need _Both_ the right program running on the _MBEB board_ **and** the PC.
* The sample PC programs below are written in Java and so should be runnable on any machine with Java.

# Simple Display
You will need two sets of code.

1. The MBED code [s7.1]{https://github.com/kf5011/s7.1}
2. The Java code [s7.1.a]{https://github.com/kf5011/s7.1.a}

Compile and run  both:

 * You'll need the Serial Monitor to see what IP address the MBED board reports itself at
 * Use that IP address in the Java program
 * enter messages in the text-box, they should appear on the LCD.

 Take some time to look through the code for each, identify

 * How are UDP Datagram sockets created
 * How they are used to
   + send messages
   + read messages
 * How is the receiving port number set?

Can messages be sent to any board?

# java ui sends control messages
You will need two sets of code.

1. The MBED code [s7.2]{https://github.com/kf5011/s7.2}
2. The Java code [s7.2.a]{https://github.com/kf5011/s7.2.a}

Compile and run both:

* you should be able to turn on and off LEDs from the Java program

Take some time to look through the code for each, identify

* How messages are formatted and created
* How messages are read and split apart
* How the lookup-table is used to set the right LED

<section class="question">
How might you extend the capabilities to control all the LEDs on the MBED board and the Application shield?
