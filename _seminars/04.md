# Serial communications to the PC
We've already come across the Serial communications to the PC by using `printf`,
and looking at the output using the Serial Monitor in Atom/PlatformIO

Example repository [s4.1](https://github.com/kf5011/s4.1) shows how an explicit serial connection can be made.  In practice there is no difference to using the plain `printf`s, unless a second serial channel is needed to other devices.

<section class="question">
What properties can you observe (these may vary from PC to PC and OS to OS)
1. At what point is data displayed?
2. Is the line buffered? (does the terminal wait for the CR/LF before displaying anything)
3. What causes the `scanf` to read the number and the program to continue?
   (you may need a reference to check the behaviour of [`scanf`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanf_format_string))
4. What is the effect of the [ANSI Escape sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) arround the "Hello" in the first print?
5. What other [ANSI Escape sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) is supported by the terminal?
6. Why can't you see characters you type in the terminal.

# Accelerometer and Magnetometer
The K64F board has an integral Accelerometer and Magnetometer (the [FXOS8700Q](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/FXOS8700CQ.pdf))

To use the library for the chip the `platformio.ini` file needs to register the
library dependencies.
```ini
lib_deps =
  hg+https://os.mbed.com/teams/components/code/MotionSensor/
  hg+https://os.mbed.com/teams/NXP/code/FXOS8700Q/
```
{:.example}

This is done in example [s4.2](https://github.com/kf5011/s4.2), fork and clone this to see how the libraries are used.

1. What units is the acceleration reported in?
2. What units is the magnetometer data reported in?
3. Which way in up for the accelerometer?

# LCD
The Application Shield uses the [C12832](http://www.newhavendisplay.com/specs/NHD-C12832A1Z-FSW-FBW-3V3.pdf) LCD Module.

PlatformIO and MBed supply the `C12832` library for using the LCD.  This needs to also go in the `platformio.ini` file:

```ini
lib_deps =
  C12832
  hg+https://os.mbed.com/teams/components/code/MotionSensor/
  hg+https://os.mbed.com/teams/NXP/code/FXOS8700Q/
```
{: .example}

The LCD is connected to specific pins and so the initialisation is fixed

```c
C12832 lcd(D11, D13, D12, D7, D10);
```
{: .example}

The display is black and white, some of the functions supported are:

```c
void pixel(int x, int y,int colour)
```
* Draw a pixel
  * `x`, `y` horizontal and vertical position  
  *  `colour`  1 set _pixel_, 0 _erase_ pixel

```c
void circle(int x, int y, int r, int colour);
```
* Draw a circle
  * `x0`,`y0`  centre of circle
  * `r` radius
  * `color` 1 _set_ pixel, 0 _erase_ pixel


```c
void fillcircle(int x, int y, int r, int colour);
```
* Draw a filled circle
  * `x0`,`y0`  centre of circle
  * `r` radius
  * `color` 1 _set_ pixel, 0 _erase_ pixel

```c
void line(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, int colour);
```
* Draw a 1 pixel line
  *  `x0`,`y0` start point
  *  `x1`,`y1` start point
  * `color` 1 _set_ pixel, 0 _erase_ pixel

```c
void rect(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, int colour);
```
* Draw a rectangle
  *  `x0`,`y0` top left corner
  *  `x1`,`y1` lower right corner
  * `color` 1 _set_ pixel, 0 _erase_ pixel

  ```c
  void fillrect(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, int colour);
  ```
  * Draw a filled rectangle
    *  `x0`,`y0` top left corner
    *  `x1`,`y1` lower right corner
    * `color` 1 _set_ pixel, 0 _erase_ pixel

```c
void cls(void);
```
* Clear the screen

```c
void character(int x, int y, int c);
```
*  Draw a character at a given position
   * `x`,`y` position of character (top left of character)
   * `c` character to print

```c
void locate(int x, int y);
```
*  Setup cursor position
  * `x`,`y` position of character (top left of character)

It also has `printf` and other standard-output functions.

See [s4.3](https://github.com/kf5011/s4.3) for a simple example.

# LCD and Sensor use

<section class="exercise">
## LCD basics
Begin by working through some exercises that cover the [basics of working
with the LCD]({{site.baseurl}}/seminars/lcd_basic.html).
</section>

Repository [s4.4](https://github.com/kf5011/s4.4) is set up to use the LCD and the Accelerometer sensor.

<section class="exercise">
## Which way is up?
Use the Accelerometer Data to determine which way up the K64F is, and then display this on the LCD (and optionally PC)
</section>

<section class="exercise">
## Digital level
Use the sensor data to measure how far away from level the K64F is.  Display this information on the LCD using suitable 
graphics (for inspiration see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_level)
</section>

<section class="exercise">
## Digital compass

This may need some research before attempting it.
{: .warning}

How is the magnetic field measured?  How can the values be used to determine which way is north?

How can you work out which way the K64F is pointing and display this information as a digital compass?

</section>
